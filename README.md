## Credits

Thanks to the Pyforms desktop GUI framework team, their documentation is currently a mess but there is more than enough 
things to build a small project. It is fast and easy to use, but I regret that this framework is not complex enough to
build advanced apps...

Requirements needed for this application were:

- PyForms~=3.0.0
- pypiwin32~=223
- pywin32~=304
